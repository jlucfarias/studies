# Required Attribute

This study was created based on [this](https://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/) blog post of The Art of Web blog.

This study is divided on two approaches:

1. A pure-HTML approach using the required attribute;
1. An HTML + CSS + Javascript approach that verify the `custom-required` attribute to recreate the first approach using a mix of the web languages and show the HTML5 required alert.
